# Green Sustainable & Open | Bond

## FeverTokens Package-Oriented Framework (POF) Implementation

## Introduction

The Green Sustainable & Open | Bond is an open-source green-bonds implementation of the so|bond framework for tokenized bonds (introduced by Crédit Agricole CIB). As an extension to the package-oriented, composable, and modular approach brought by FeverTokens (FeverTokens POF), this solution integrates on-chain monitoring and oversight throughout the entire lifecycle of green bonds. Moreover, it is off-chain compatible and interoperable with current as well as future standards. This is possible thanks to the modular Diamond Standard engineering that keeps the smart contract infrastructure flexible, scalable, and highly maintainable. This implementation will boost the transparency and trust in green bonds while enhancing the advantages that blockchain-based digital assets promise.

## About the FeverTokens POF

At FeverTokens, we have developed an extensive open-source framework known for its modularity, package-oriented design as well as scalability in advanced smart contract development, all built upon the Diamond Standard. The integration of modularity, composability, interoperability, and built-in security, governance, and compliance are there to ensure functional scalability marked by high flexibility, scalability, and safety as well as by low cost and time-to-market. Currently, we are collaborating with CA-CIB to work on the next-generation of so|bond by introducing the above elements, notably the Diamond Standard and a package-centric approach, in order to enhance functional scalability in production-ready, full-lifecycle management of tokenized bonds. Meanwhile, FeverTokens has won the 2nd edition of the CAST challenge organized in July 2023 by SG-Forge and other leading institutional players for a smart contract implementation that enables native interoperability with international standards.

The proposed implementation leverages a Diamond-powered architecture, which underpins our package-oriented framework. A Diamond-powered architecture is well-suited for coping with the evolution of industry standards. The modularity and granularity of packages allow for easier continual progress and community contribution. Packages are developed in Solidity and can operate on any EVM-compatible blockchain. The full implementation is an open-source extension of the upgraded so|bond, and is compatible with FeverTokens’ management panel tooling. This is essential for gaining maximum trust and transparency in the tooling, which are qualities aligned with the quest for data integrity in green bonds.

## Project Features

The proposed solution incorporates a range of features that will not only ensure data integrity for tokenized bonds but also enhance the advantages that blockchain-based digital assets promise.

1. The implementation leverages on-chain monitoring and oversight on reported data throughout the lifecycle of a tokenized green bond.
2. It will also be compatible with off-chain issuance and settlement operations. This optional feature is possible thanks to the Diamond Standard architecture.
3. It will be compatible with FeverTokens’ management panel tooling. This feature enables investors, auditors, and issuers to manage all aspects of the green bond throughout its lifecycle on-chain. Hence, not only is data integrity enhanced but we also benefit from lower management cost.
4. It is compatible with the CAST standard on digital assets, and it will integrate ICMA’s Green Bond Principles (GBP) as well as EU’s Green Bond Standard (EUGBS) by design.
5. It builds on a modular, highly-interoperable open-source framework, which can attract third-party contributions in a collaborative fashion that significantly boosts the speed and scale of adoption.

## Usage and Customization

The base implementation provided in this repository is not intended for direct deployment. Instead, it serves as a reference model for building customized and more sophisticated POF-based smart contracts. Users are encouraged to extend, modify, and adapt the packages according to their specific project needs.
